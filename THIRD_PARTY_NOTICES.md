# Third-Party Notices

NovaBay（万象星核） is distributed under GPL-3.0-only. This repository includes,
adapts, reimplements, preinstalls, or references behavior from the projects
listed below. An integration label describes that relationship; a behavioral
reference does not mean that source code from the referenced project is
embedded.

Retained license and attribution files are stored with corresponding sources
under `vendor/` and `assets/`. Exact integration paths and update channels are
recorded in `upstreams.json`.

### Media Resource Discovery

- Cat Catch 2.7.2, embedded runtime presented as “顺手牵羊”, GPL-3.0
- Source revision `ef630f8ff88ca9a3ebbfaa1ea01e1512b9e6778a`
- Source: https://github.com/xifangczy/cat-catch
- Retained source and license: `vendor/cat-catch/`
- The original popup, options, downloader, parsers, media controls, capture
  scripts, resource detection and external integrations are packaged directly.
- A thin adapter isolates Cat Catch storage and toolbar state so the embedded
  runtime cannot replace NovaBay's toolbar icon, Side Panel or storage.
- Modified by NovaBay on 2026-08-21: Cat Catch's cat-logo image assets were
  replaced with NovaBay's sheep artwork; media detection and download
  behavior remain provided by the attributed Cat Catch runtime.
